# Sign-Language-Recognition-
This is my first project with python ,sign language gesture recognition from video sequences using RNN and CNN.
As a first try , we'll just try to recognise three signs : Justice , House and Pay , as the dataset of the whole signs is huge ( 50 gb ).
To run this project :
